			<div><p>Hi there! My name is Roman. I am a C++ developer with 2+ years of working experience. This is my corner on the Internet :&#41;</p>
			<p>My story began when I was 13 years old, and for the first time, I thought "How games are made?". This was the start of my journey in programming and after trying a couple of programming languages it led me to C++ with which I stick until now.</p>
			<p>I though, I would be a great idea to start a personal blog to share something with the Internet.</p>
			<p>My github: <a href="https://github.com/RomanSannikov">https://github.com/RomanSannikov</a></p></div>
